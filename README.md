This is a simple Ethereum smart contract written in Solidity that implements the Proof Of Learn (CRED) token. This README file provides an introduction to the smart contract, code explanations, compilation instructions, deployment steps, and an introduction to Remix, an online Solidity IDE.

# Smart Contract Introduction

**Name:** Proof Of Learn Token
**Symbol**: CRED
**Total Supply**: 0 (Tokens will be minted as needed)

### The smart contract includes two essential functions:

**mintTokens(address _to, uint256 _value) external:** This function is used to create new CRED tokens and assign them to a specified address.

**burn(uint256 _value) external:** This function allows token holders to withdraw CRED tokens from their balance.

# Code Explanations

string public tokenName and string public tokenSymbol declare the name and symbol of the token, respectively.

uint256 public totalSupply keeps track of the total supply of CRED tokens.

mapping(address => uint256) public balances maps addresses to their token balances, allowing users to check their balance by calling balances[address].

mintTokens function allows anyone to create CRED tokens and assign them to a specified address. It increases the total supply and updates the balance of the recipient.

burn function allows a token holder to withdraw CRED tokens from their balance. It checks if the sender has enough tokens, reduces the total supply, and updates the balance accordingly.

# Compilation

You can compile this Solidity smart contract using the Solidity compiler (solc) or Remix. Below are the steps for using Remix:

# Deployment
To deploy the Proof Of Learn (CRED) Token Smart Contract, follow these steps:

Compile the Smart Contract: Make sure the contract is compiled successfully in Remix.

Select Environment: In Remix, select the appropriate environment (JavaScript VM, Injected Web3, or a custom network like Ethereum Mainnet or a testnet).

Deploy the Contract: Click the "Deploy" button in Remix to deploy the contract to the selected environment.

Confirm Transaction: Confirm the transaction in your wallet (if using an external provider).

Interact with the Contract: Once deployed, you can interact with the contract by calling its functions from within Remix or any other Ethereum-compatible application.

# Introduction to Remix

Remix is an online Solidity integrated development environment (IDE) that provides a user-friendly interface for writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It offers features like code editing, compilation, deployment, and debugging, making it a valuable tool for Ethereum developers.

**To get started with Remix:**

- Visit Remix.

- Select an environment (e.g., JavaScript VM for testing or Injected Web3 for interaction with real Ethereum networks).

- Write or import your Solidity code.

- Compile your code by clicking the "Compile" tab.

- Deploy your contract using the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab.
